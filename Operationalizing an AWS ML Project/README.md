### Operationalizing as AWS ML project 
in this project is about completed machine learning project start from training data and make deployment on serveless application like lambda function on AWS
the project is done as follow :
##1-train model that written with 'pytorch'
##2-How to Managing computing resources efficiently to reduce cost and turn off all instances after training and chose an efficient and suitable EC2 type for this task
##3-Training models with large datasets using multi-instance training to reduce time 
##4-Setting up high-throughput, low-latency pipelines by apply auto-scaling in our endpoint to can haandle high traffic and response quickly and alos setup concurency for
lambda function to handle efficient eith high-throuphput and achieve low-latency
##5-AWS security in sagemaker and also on EC2 by using VPC
