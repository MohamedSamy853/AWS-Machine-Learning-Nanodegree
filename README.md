# Project 1 : Bredict Bike Sharing Demend using AutoGloun
In this project, you'll use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. You will be using Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project will demonstrate your ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record your personal optimization of the problem.
# Project 2 :Build a Ml Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon Sagemaker
In this project, you'll be building an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.
 youâ€™ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. You'll deploy your model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose your model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project, you will have created a portfolio-ready demo that showcases your ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
